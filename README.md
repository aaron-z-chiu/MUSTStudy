# MUSTStudy: A Curriculum‑Aligned Learning Hub for CS Student @ MUST
Final Project for SE Course @ SCSE, FIE, MUST

## Project Description
MUSTStudy is a curriculum-aligned learning hub that curates and annotates high-quality videos, notes, and exercises, mapping them precisely to the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST). 

The project structures resources into course- and week-level pathways with precise time-coded “start/stop” cues, bilingual framing notes for clarity, and OS-specific setup sprints to ensure cross-platform readiness. The expected result is reduced search time, improved studying efficiency, and strengthened learning confidence across the cohort.

It solves the following problems: 
*	Misalignment with MUST syllabus: High-quality external courses often follow different topic orderings, assumed backgrounds, and assessment emphases than those used at the MUST. This divergence wastes study time on irrelevant segments and leaves gaps in examinable material unless resources are precisely mapped to each week of the local syllabus.
*	Absence of prerequisite bridges: Several modules presuppose competencies not uniformly taught beforehand (e.g. Java fundamentals). Without concise, course-anchored ramp-ups and quick diagnostics, students accrue “prerequisite debt,” slowing progress on assignments and undermining confidence.
*	Difficulty acquiring non-syllabus skills: Some of the essential operational skills that are useful in practice but are not explicitly credit-bearing in the curriculum, such as multi-OS toolchain setup and verification (Windows/macOS/Linux), Git workflows (branching/PRs/conflicts), build and dependency management (Make/CMake, package managers), unit testing & CI basics, and troubleshooting of compilers/linkers/network tools.
